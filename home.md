# What is the WRCT wiki?
Wikipedia defines a wiki as a web application that allows users to add content, as on an Internet forum, but also allows anyone to edit the content. The word "wiki" comes from the Hawaiian "wiki wiki" meaning "quick" or "informal."
The WRCT wiki is a gigantic repository of information related to the station and its various departments. It is completely open--anyone can edit anything. Therefore, if you have information to add or something to say, do it! (Naturally, only do it if it's relevant, accurate, and helpful.) It's also a lot of fun to browse around if you're curious.

# What's on here, anyway?
We should probably begin with the list of wiki webs WRCT's wiki is split into. You can also see this list at the bottom of the sidebar on the left of every page. First, the list of webs directly related to WRCT:
* Business: This web holds information related to the station's finances, and is maintained by the Business Manager.
* Engineering: Here, technical information relating to WRCT's equipment is stored and maintained by the Chief Engineer and the Engineering staph.
* GM: This web stores information relating to the executive management of WRCT, the General Manager, and the License Board. It is maintained by the General Manager.
* ISM: Filled with information regarding the computing resources of the station, you'll find just about everything you wanted to know about ISM here (including that the acronym means Information Systems Management). It's maintained by the ISM Director and the ISM staph.
* Music: The Internal and External Music Directors and the Record Librarian store information here related to the flow of music around the station in all of its various forms.
* PA: Here, one can find information regarding the Public Affairs programs that are part of WRCT. It's maintained by the PA Director and the PA hosts.
* PR: Public Relations information is stored here, with sections for Underwriting, Art, and Carnival. It is maintained by the PR Director and his/her assistants.
* Production: Here, information about producing WRCT material is held. It is maintained by the Production Director and Production staph.
* Program: This web stores information about programming the WRCT schedule, DJing, and everything that entails. It is maintained by the Program Director.
* Staph: This web contains information relating to every member of the station's staph, such as forms and minutes, and a station history. It is maintained by the Staph Representative.

And now, the ones that just come with having the kind of wiki we do:

* Main: This web stores little information, it simply serves as the jumping-off point to the other webs. In fact, this is where you are right now. Also, this web holds the profiles of all wiki users.
* Sandbox: This web allows you just to play around and get a feel for using wiki software.
* TWiki: This web stores information about the software powering this wiki. It is where to go for infromation about how to use the TWiki system.

Click one of those options and feel free to browse around! Almost all of the wiki is interesting in some way. Here are the only two other interesting pages in the Main web, while you're around.
