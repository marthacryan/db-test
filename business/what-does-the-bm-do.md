<!-- TITLE: What Does The Business Manager Do? -->

Since the Business Manager is on the Executive Board, only an Activities Fee-paying CMU affiliate can run for the position. The position is elected yearly in the Spring according to the constitution.
The constitution defines the BM position as:

The Business Manager is responsible for the management of the financial resources of the station; he or she is charged with recording any purchase made with WRCT funds, creating the annual budget, and serving as the Executive Board's liaison to the financial personnel of the Carnegie Mellon University Office of Student Activities and to the Joint Funding Committee of Carnegie Mellon University Student Senate and Graduate Student Assembly.

The work takes about 1-3 hours a week and is usually quite easy in nature if you stay on top of it. The most difficult part involves keeping track of where money is spent.
