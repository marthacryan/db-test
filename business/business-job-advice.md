<!-- TITLE: Business Job Advice -->

Here are some tips to help make the job easier
# Record Keeping
* Keep some record of which line item in the budget allocation a purchase was for
* Divide purchases into departmental categories (Every Exec Board member should get a category)
# Buying stuff
* Use the Tartan Card whenever possible (SA will thank you)
* Minimize use of reimbursements, people get irate when they're late getting checks and I've been known to be owed over $200 at one point from WRCT and it's not a good position to be in for anyone
# Social Issues
* Be friends with Student Activities.
* Try to be on Ben Davis' side when people get upset. He is your ally in SA and there's no use in not supporting him helping you out.
* Don't be afraid to bother people in Student Activities. Their job is to help us spend our money.
# Workflow
* Weekly emptying of the Business Mailbox and processing of everything in there should keep you on top without too much work
* Get good at email, respond/send/forward promptly
* Get good at doing what you say you will do
# Philosophy
The Business Manager should attempt to remain in complete control of the station's finances, while at the same time exerting no control over the station's money. Clear? This is hard to achieve, since it is strangely very difficult to know the exact state of the station's finances. For real, because it has really been a problem for me this year. It is also difficult to exert no control over the money, because you may be put in a position where people seek you out as the last word on a purchasing decision. My recommendation? Make the GM or an execboard vote be the last word.
