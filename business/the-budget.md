<!-- TITLE: The Budget -->

WRCT receives its funding from the Joint Funding Committee (JFC), a committee made up of representatives from both Student Senate, and the Graduate Student Assembly. All recognized student groups receive funding this way.
Each spring semester, usually February, the Business Manager, with help from other members of the exec board, create the budget proposal for the following year with all of the potential expenses and income to submit to the JFC. The JFC then meets and discusses the proposal, and makes a decision on the amount of funding WRCT will receive. 

Boring details and steps in the process

* Take last year's budget, and make updates and changes to it
* Meet with JFC advisor to discuss items on budget so he or she is familiar with all items on the budget proposal
* Submit proposal to JFC by deadline in BudgetTracker
* JFC makes funding decision based on the funding proposal and what the JFC advisor said about the proposal (READ - meeting with advisor is important)
* Appeal their funding decision if necessary
* Appeal process involves both a written and verbal appeal to the JFC.

Next year (2006) the Business Manager should scrap every single cost number on the budget and reassign each line item with an updated cost. I think that some of those costs have not been updated in years (not in 21st century). This should be done in consultation with other exec members. Any new line items should have the most up to date cost estimate available. If its not to your "liking," then revise from there.
